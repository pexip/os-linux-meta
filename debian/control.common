Description: Linux kernel crashdump setup for the latest generic kernel
 This package installs all the needed infrstracture to get crashdumps from
 your running system. If you are experiencing kernel crashes that cannot
 be debugged normally (because the problem is infrequent or panic's the
 system in such a way as to make information gathering impossible), then
 you can install this package to automatically enable capture of the
 vmcore on crashes.

# This comment applies to the following 4 meta packages.
#
# Point to a 12.04 kernel until such time as 12.10 is released. Then update
# to point to linux-image-generic-lts-backport-quantal. The -hwe- package
# is not updated until just before a point release. However, the -current-
# package always tracks the most recent release. In that way, -hwe- will
# sometimes lag for a few months before being updated to match -current-.
